# o-data-query-builder
A typescript library for build OData queries.

## Inspirations
This library was made based in two others libraries: 
<a href="https://github.com/skynet2/ngx-odata">ngx-odata</a>
and 
<a href="https://github.com/jaredmahan/odata-query-builder">odata-query-builder</a>. It was taken parts of both and mixed. The goal is to do something diferent, but not start from the stratch.
